## Programming Module
As our team uses the old programming modules, in order to use these modules with the new RobotC, you will have to download a driver. Information about these drivers can be found [on the Vex website](http://www.vexrobotics.com/276-2186.html). If you have a version later than Windows 8, the Windows 8 Prolific USB Driver will work just as well (as tested with a Windows 10 Computer). It has yet to be tested on a MAC device.

This device allows the user to program a robot through a VEXnet connected controller. This allows the user to see from the computer debugger values as seen from the robot while still allowing connectivity to driver control. In order to use this module, the following steps must be taken:

1. Pair the robot to be programmed with a VEXjoystick
1. Plug in programming module to the programming socket on the VEXjoystick and to the computer to program
1. Turn on both the robot and the VEXjoystick with a VEXnet connecting the two
1. Program as needed
